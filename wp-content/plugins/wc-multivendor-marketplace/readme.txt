= Feedback = 

All we want is love. We are extremely responsive about support requests - so if you face a problem or find any bugs, shoot us a mail or post it in the support forum, and we will respond within 6 hours(during business days). If you get the impulse to rate the plugin low because it is not working as it should, please do wait for our response because the root cause of the problem may be something else. 

It is extremely disheartening when trigger happy users downrate a plugin for no fault of the plugin. 

Feel free to reach us either via our [support forum](https://wclovers.com/forums) or [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wc-multivendor-marketplace), happy to serve anything you looking for.

Inspired by WC Marketplace, Dokan Multivendor, WC Vendors, Amazon, Zomato and all other marketplace solutions, really thankful to all of them :) 

Really proud to serve and enhance [WooCommerce](http://woocommerce.com).

Be with us ... Team [WC Lovers](https://wclovers.com)
